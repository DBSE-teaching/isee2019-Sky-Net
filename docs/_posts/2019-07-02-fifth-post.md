## Overview

## Technical Challenges Our Team Encountered
<p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Our team consisted of members with different backgrounds and experiences. This helped us in diverse thinking, but we also faced the following technical challenges during the process.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Our team consisted of members with little or no prior experience in programming and software development approaches.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">We never had prior experience in developing an android application.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Integrating multiple features such as Navigation bar, charts, email summary in the application was quite difficult.</p></li>
   <li><p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Content writing for the blog sometimes required a lot to research as several topics such as Use Case diagrams, User stories were quite new to us.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
 ## Challenges Faced When Working As A Team
  
 ### Difficulty in making decisions as a team
  
  <p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">During the initial team meetings, we were not able to manage good brainstorming sessions. We individually had unique ideas whether it comes to designing the application or solving a technical issue. But we were unable to visualize the perspective of the fellow team member or choose the best possible result in that scenario.</p>
  
  <p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">We realized this problem after the completion of “Basic prototype” and started the successive prototypes with an initial brainstorming session on the requirements provided and developed a well-defined execution workflow.</p>
  
### Poor communication and Lack of participation
 
 <p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Our means of communication was mainly digital - Trello (with respect to sharing documents and delegating works) and Whatsapp (to share information immediately). Initially, we did not plan many personal meetings as we were uncertain of each other’s schedule. During the team meetings, there were the following problems: poor attendance, low energy, failing to address the problem or members talking simultaneously or being silent over the session.</p>
 
## Benefits of Working as a Team

### Diverse Thinking

<p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">We were from different backgrounds, some of us were good at programming, testing, designing or had good experience in apprehending app from an end user perspective. So each had unique skills, background, and experiences. In many scenarios, fellow team members helped each other to see things from a different angle. </p>

### More work in less time

<p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Once we receive the requirements, we have broken it to individual user stories and delegated the work among ourselves in Trello. In the same time frame, we were able to complete our individual tasks and finally merged them to form the final product.</p>

## How the course did meet your needs or fall short?
