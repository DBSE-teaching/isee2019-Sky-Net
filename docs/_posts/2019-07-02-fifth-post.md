## Overview
<p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Here we are,Team Sky-Net, after three months of combined efforts and sleepless nights, we dedicate this blog to our teamwork endevours and look back at the past and appreciate our achievements. We also take this moment and thank everyone responsible for bringing up such a course.</P>

## Technical Challenges Our Team Encountered

<p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Our team consisted of members with different backgrounds and experiences. This helped us in diverse thinking, but we also faced the following technical challenges during the process.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Our team consisted of members with little or no prior experience in programming and software development approaches.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">We never had prior experience in developing an android application.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Integrating multiple features such as Navigation bar, charts, email summary in the application was quite difficult.</p></li>
   <li><p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Content writing for the blog sometimes required a lot to research as several topics such as Use Case diagrams, User stories were quite new to us.</p></li>
</ul>

## Challenges Faced When Working As A Team
  
### Difficulty in making decisions as a team
  
  <p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">During the initial team meetings, we were not able to manage good brainstorming sessions. We individually had unique ideas whether it comes to designing the application or solving a technical issue. But we were unable to visualize the perspective of the fellow team member or choose the best possible result in that scenario.</p>
  
  <p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">We realized this problem after the completion of “Basic prototype” and started the successive prototypes with an initial brainstorming session on the requirements provided and developed a well-defined execution workflow.</p>

### Discovering Individual Fortitudes of the Team Members
 
 <p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">When people come together for a group project or an activity, they often tend to have varying potentials and skill sets. Such scenarios also existed among us at the beginning stages. Sharing the tasks accordingly was confusing and time-consuming at the initial stages of the project. The weekly meeting helped us out a lot in this regard and taking responsibilities were straightforward.</p>

### Time Management 
<p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">The weekly deadlines were justified with at most accuracy nevertheless, there were tasks which took a toll on the limited time we had and submissions were pushed closer to the deadline. The root cause of such a problem is due to the fact that our team members have different free time and we had to overhaul our schedule to cope up with the deadlines. Ultimately the lead time was reduced towards the end of the course.</P>

## Benefits of Working as a Team

### Diverse Thinking

<p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">We were from different backgrounds, some of us were good at programming, testing, designing or had good experience in apprehending app from an end user perspective. So each had unique skills, background, and experiences. In many scenarios, fellow team members helped each other to see things from a different angle. </p>
