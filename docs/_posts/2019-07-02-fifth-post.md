## Overview

## Technical Challenges Our Team Encountered
<p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Our team consisted of members with different backgrounds and experiences. This helped us in diverse thinking, but we also faced the following technical challenges during the process.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Our team consisted of members with little or no prior experience in programming and software development approaches.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">We never had prior experience in developing an android application.</p></li>
  <li><p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Integrating multiple features such as Navigation bar, charts, email summary in the application was quite difficult.</p></li>
   <li><p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Content writing for the blog sometimes required a lot to research as several topics such as Use Case diagrams, User stories were quite new to us.</p></li>
