### What is the app about?

<p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">Exspendables is an application we have developed, that helps an individual to monitor oneâ€™s day to day expenses. The interface is kept simple and clean to make use of all the functionalities that is needed to plan and manage the finances. Recurring payments are created automatically, and new income or expenses can be entered with just few clicks. Tracking of income /expense can be done through our visualization panel in the form of pie charts and bar graphs. Additionally the entries can be viewed in table form. Functionalities were given higher priorities in our development process. Ultimately the aim was to create an application which is dynamic in its functionalities in all aspects.</p>
