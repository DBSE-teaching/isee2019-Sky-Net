# Basic Prototype

## Overview

As we have succesfully completed our first milestone presentation, now we move on to the next phase in our application development.
This phase showcases our team effort in progressing with how we have understood the requirement from the product owner, the problems we have encountered while developing our application.

## Requirements & Specifications

Requirements being the first and important step towards a software development. We basically categorised them in to three parts as to how we have progressed.

 --> Requirement Input : We held weekly meetings with the product owner and the stakeholders to understand what needs to be built from          their perspective. All the requirements area mbiguously taken and various parameters pertaining the requirements are agreed.
 
 
 --> Requirement Analysis : Based on the discussed requirement, we have seen the feasibility from a technical perspective and understood if      there are any technical limitation due to which the particular requirement could not implemented.
 
 
 --> Requirement Documentation : We have documented the discussed requirements in the form of epics and user stories below.
