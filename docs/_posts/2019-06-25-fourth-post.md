# Beta Prototype

## Overview

<p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify">After our successful implementation of the Basic Prototype, we have moved on to the next phase in our application development. In this phase, we have received further requirements from the Product Owner. The given set of requirements are a must have and also this includes some alterations to be done over the previously implemented prototype. We have adapted ourselves to these dynamic requirements and modified the code accordingly.</p>
