# Beta Prototype

## Overview 

<p style="font-family:Times;font-size:110%;text-align:justify"> We have reached the beginning of the end of the development of our application. Most of the user stories were implemented into working prototypes. Thus we have reached a stage where the application needs to be tested for the users to have an unparalleled and effortless experience. For this purpose, we have made use of the two existing testing methods, namely Black box testing and White box testing.  In this blog, we have explained these methods in detail.
